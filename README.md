# Harvesting-Robot-Arm
Harvesting tomatoes in greenhouses by using robot arm
(2024):
Designed and implemented an advanced robotic arm system for harvesting tomatoes in greenhouses. The system features six degrees of freedom, providing flexibility in movement, and includes a custom-designed end effector to gently pick tomatoes. The project was divided into three key areas:	 Mechanical Design: Developed the structure and movement capabilities of the arm using advanced engineering tools.	Electronics and Control: Utilized microcontrollers to control motors, integrating sensors for precision. Software and Application: Programmed the system for remote operation via a mobile application, enabling real-time control and monitoring.
